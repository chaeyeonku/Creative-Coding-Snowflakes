Inspired by interactive coding projects on YouTube (channel: interactive developer), I decided to create a similar creative coding project.
In this project, users can create randomized snowflakes on screen and interact with them via mouse clicks and buttons provided.

* Reference: To create a circular motion, I referenced Chris Courses- "How to Code: Circular Motion" YouTube video (https://youtu.be/raXW5J1Te7Y) and modified the code to meet my needs.
